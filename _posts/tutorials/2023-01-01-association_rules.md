<h3>Introduction</h3>
Association rules are a powerful technique in unsupervised learning that identify relationships and patterns in data. Unlike clustering, which groups data based on similarities, association rules focus on finding associations or correlations between items in datasets.

<h3>Main</h3>
Association rule mining transforms raw data into meaningful associations and rules that describe relationships among items or events. The primary types of association rule mining include:

- <b>Frequent Itemset Mining:</b> Identifies sets of items that frequently co-occur in transactions. 
- <b>Rule Generation:</b> Derives actionable rules that describe the relationships between different items or events based on their co-occurrence. 

Association rule mining can be classified into different types:

- <b>Apriori Algorithm:</b> A classic algorithm that identifies frequent itemsets by iteratively pruning non-frequent sets.
- <b>FP-Growth Algorithm:</b> Uses a frequent pattern growth approach to efficiently mine frequent itemsets.

<h3>Example uses</h3>
Examples of association rule mining applications include:

- <b>Market Basket Analysis:</b> Analysing customer purchase patterns to discover associations between products frequently bought together.
- <b>Cross-Selling:</b> Identifying product associations to enhance recommendations and increase sales.
- <b>Medical Diagnosis:</b> Discovering patterns in patient records to assist in disease diagnosis and treatment planning.
- <b>Web Usage Mining:</b> Understanding user behavior on websites to optimise content placement and user experience.

<h3>Example algorthims</h3>
Common algorithms used in association rule mining include:

- Apriori
- FP-Growth

<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
Association rule mining offers several advantages:

- Interpretability: Rules generated are easily interpretable and actionable.
- Scalability: Efficient algorithms exist for mining large datasets.
- Versatility: Applicable across diverse domains from retail to healthcare.

However, there are also challenges:

- Computational Complexity: Mining association rules from large datasets can be computationally expensive.
- Quality of Rules: Generating meaningful rules requires careful parameter tuning and consideration of support and confidence thresholds.
