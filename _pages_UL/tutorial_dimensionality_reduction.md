<h3>Background</h3>
<i>Dimensional reduction</i> is a common unsupervised learning approach.  It reduces the number of features (input variables) to a manageable size.  Sometimes the number of input variables is too high or addes little value to the model.  Further, more features make the modelling more complex - sometimes unncessarily complex.  Hence, <i>dimensional reduction</i> addresses this issue.

<h3>Main</h3>
<i>Dimensional reduction</i> is commonly used during the stage of preprocessing data stage.

The following are examples of <i>dimensional reduction</i> methods:
