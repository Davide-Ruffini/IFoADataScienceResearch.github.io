<h3>Overview / Background</h3>
Machine Learning is filtering into several industries and our daily lives.  [TO CONTINUE]

<h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>

’’The field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience”.  – Tom Mitchell: Machine learning 1st Edition (1997)

Machine learning is a sub-category of artificial intelligence that refers to the process by which computers develop pattern recognition, or the ability to continuously learn from and predictions based on data, then adjust without being specifically programmed to do so. 

There are two types of problems that machine learning can solve:
•	Regression analysis: The problem we are trying to solve is if we can predict a response variable based on a predictor variable, for example, predicting a house price from the square meters; and 
•	Classification: The problem we are trying to solve is if we can determine where a particular instance belongs to, for example, is a particular email spam or not.

The three major machine learning algorithms are as follows:
•	Supervised learning: Supervised learning uses the dataset which contains both the predictor and response variables, and it uses a known dataset to make future predictions or classifications;
•	Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning uses the dataset which does not have a labelled response variable and is commonly used for clustering analysis i.e. to identify similar groups or patterns;
•	Semi-supervised learning: Semi-supervised learning uses the dataset which is partially labelled and the algorithm uses the labelled data to understand the parameters for interpreting the unlabelled data; and

<h3>Machine learning algorithm – Selection process</h3>
The selection of machine learning algorithm depends on the data available and the question we want to ask.
