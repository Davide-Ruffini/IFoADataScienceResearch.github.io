##Background
Machine Learning is becoming prominent in our day-to-day lives.  We probably are unaware that Machine Learning is being used by businesses and enterprises to simplify tasks and bring a wider service to us as a user.  Below are some real-world examples of where Machine Learning is being used. 

##Examples - Machine Learning

* Image recongition
Social media apps such as Facebook use Machine Learning to give suggestions for "tagging" people in photos.

* Speech recognition
Amazon Alexa or Google Home uses Machine Learning to interpret speech commands to produce search results or take instruction.

* Travel
Google Maps for example can interpret a large volume of data via Machine Learning techniques to suggest alternative quicker routes whilst driving.

* Communication
Email messages and smart phones now give suggested responses when they notice certain text triggers.

* Chat bots
More companies and services are provided online.  Given the volume of potential traffic, chat bots can be used to automate responses, minimising the need of human interaction with the aim of hopefully addressing the user's queries efficiently and quickly.
