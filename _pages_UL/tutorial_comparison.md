<h3>Introduction</h3>
Supervised, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised and reinforced learning are 4 fundamental approaches of machine learning:
--  <br /> <b>Supervised Learning</b> 
--  <br /><b>Unsupervised Learning</b>
--  <br /><b>Semi-Supervised Learning</b>
--  <br /><b>Reinforced Learning</b>



<h3>Overview comparison between these methods</h3>
