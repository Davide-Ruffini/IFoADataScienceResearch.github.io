# IFoA Data Science Research Section
Web page of IFoA Data Science Research Section

The IFoA Data Science Research Section is an international research community, consisting of actuaries, data scientists, statisticians and academics meeting regularly to research and develop data science techniques in actuarial and insurance applications. We organised and disseminate our works through research working parties.

We aim to achieve this by:

1. Identifying interesting actuarial data science research problems and data sets
2. Conducting research and case studies, including but not limited to pricing, underwriting, capital modelling, mortality, morbidity, fraud, customer behaviour, privacy and technology
3. Publishing data science case studies and papers, via The Actuary magazine, journals, webinars, web blogs, LinkedIn and conferences
