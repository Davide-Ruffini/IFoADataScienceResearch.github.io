<b> What is Sentiment Analysis? </b>

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining or emotion AI, refer to the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analytics to automatically determine the overall feeling a writer is expressing in a piece of text.

Sentiment classification is often framed as binary (positive/negative), ternary (positive/neutral/negative) or multi-class (for example neutral, happy, sad, anger, hate).

Sentiment analysis is used in many applications:
<ul>
  <li>
Monitor and analyse online and social media content around a specific topic
  </li>
  <li>
Evaluating survey response
  </li>
  <li>
Voice of the customer analysis, leading to value proposition
  </li>
  <li>
Product analytics: e.g. categorising product reviews
  </li>
  <li>
Improve Customer Support and feedback analysis
  </li>
  <li>
Reputation and Brand management
  </li>
  <li>
Market Research, Competitor Analysis
  </li>
</ul>

<b> Research Aims </b>

In this work, we consider the problem of classifying sentiment of UK Twitter messages on COVID19 using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised Machine Learning techniques

Our research considers the following: 
<ul>
  <li>
    Labelling sentiments using emoticons (a noisy method) 
  </li>
  <li>
    Data enrichment using a non-COVID Twitter dataset (sentiment140) 
  </li>
  <li>
    NLP pipeline for pre-processing Twitter data
  </li>
  <li>
Encoding methods: Bag-of-words (BoW),Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), GLoVE (Global Vectors for Word Representation) 
  </li>
  <li>
    Comparison of ‘out-of-the-box sentiment classifier’ vs Machine Learning predictive models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, XGBoost 
  </li>
  <li>
    Visualisation of time-series results for overall UK Twitter sentiment, and for Tweets relating to keywords, such as ‘nhs’ ‘stayathome’, ‘work’, ‘government’
