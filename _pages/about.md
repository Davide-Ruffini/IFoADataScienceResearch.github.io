The IFoA Data Science Research Section consists of an international group of actuaries, data scientists, statisticians and academics meeting regularly to research and develop data science techniques in actuarial and insurance applications.

We aim to achieve this by:

1. Identify interesting actuarial data science research problems and data sets
2. Conducting research and case studies, including but not limited to pricing, underwriting, capital modelling, mortality, morbidity, fraud, customer behaviour and automation
3. Publishing data science case studies and insights

Currently we have eight workstreams:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Federated Learning
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
4. Unsupervised Learning
5. Autoencoder
6. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and model interpretability
7. Visualisation
8. Contents and website
