The IFoA Data Science Research Section, part of the Institute and Faculty of Actuariesâ€™ Data Science Working Party, consists of an international group of actuaries , data scientists and academics meeting regularly to research and develop data science techniques in actuarial applications.

The objective of the Data Science Research workstream is to:

1. Identify interesting actuarial data science research problems and data sets
2. Conduct data science research and case studies, including but not limited to pricing, underwriting, mortality and morbidity, fraud, customer behaviour and automation.
3. Collate Data Science use cases and case studies and make them accessible

Currently we have three workstreams:
1. Federated Learning
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
3. Supervised Learning

We plan to form additional workstreams in the future:
1. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and model interpretability
2. Visualisation
3. Unsupervised Learning
4. Autoencoders
