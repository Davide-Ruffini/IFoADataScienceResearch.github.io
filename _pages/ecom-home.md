## Aims
1. Explore interesting open source embedded insurance data sets and discuss how data analytics techniques can be used for actuarial applications, including risk selection (for life and GI products), identifying insurance opportunities and market segmentation.
2. Investigate the intersection of machine learning and traditional actuarial techniques in embedded insurance data, especially in the area of insurance product pricing and loss management

## What is Embedded Insurance?
Embedded insurance refers to the act of introducing relevant insurance coverage or protection during a customer's purchase journey of another product or services [<a href="https://www.mapfre.com/en/insights/innovation/embedded-insurance/">1</a>]. The insurance itself is not the main product being purchased but serves to provide the customer with a stronger value proposition in the form of protection and peace of mind.

Embedded insurance has historically played a leading role offline, such as packaging car insurance with new car purchases, mortagage insurance with home loans and extended warranty with electronics. However, the pandemic has driven many of these activities online across different sectors. This includes:

* e-commerce sites such as Amazon
* ride hailing services such as Uber
* digital financial services such as Monzo and and Revolut
* telemedicine and teleconsultation services such as Babylon and Push Doctor

These sites continue to capture more and more offline traffic and represents a fundamental shift to how insurance can be sold with increased relevance and affinity to a specific audience. 

## What is the relevance of data science to embedded insurance?
The various services mentioned above capture a significant amount of information from its users. This is necessary in order to provide a good user experience and more importantly to provide to offer basic functionality to its users. 

Uber for example, collects data to monitor traffic conditions and driver's availability [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amazing-ways-uber-using-big-data-analytics-bernard-marr/">2</a>] in order to estimate the optimal fare for riders. Amazon trawls through its data to provide purchase recommendations to drive sales.

The same data mentioned can also be utilised to price car insurance, assess users' risk and recommend embedded insurance to users of these services. Examples include:

* Adjusting the premium loading of insurance offered to buyers of different risk
* Assess the insurance needs of buyers' based on purchase history and recommend relevant products
* Customising insurance at an individual level according to buyers' risk profile
* Real time emedding of appropriate insurance based on weather [<a href="https://www.droplet.sg/#/">3</a>]

Traditional actuarial techniques can then evolve to complement the influx of real time data to enable more accurate estimates. Innovative products can also be borne out of data based on actual needs instead of the usual cookie-cutter products.
