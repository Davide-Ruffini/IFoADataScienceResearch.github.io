## What is Embedded Insurance?
Embedded insurance refers to the act of introducing relevant insurance coverage or protection during a customer's purchase journey of another product or services [<a href="https://www.mapfre.com/en/insights/innovation/embedded-insurance/">1</a>]. The insurance itself is not the main product being purchased but serves to provide the customer with a stronger value proposition in the form of protection and peace of mind.

Embedded insurance has historically played a leading role offline, such as packaging car insurance with new car purchases, mortagage insurance with home loans and extended warranty with electronics. However, the pandemic has driven many of these activities online across different sectors. This includes:

* e-commerce sites such as Amazon
* ride hailing services such as Uber
* digital financial services such as Monzo and and Revolut
* telemedicine and teleconsultation services such as Babylon and Push Doctor

These sites continue to capture more and more offline traffic and represents a fundamental shift to how insurance can be sold with increased relevance and affinity to a specific audience.
