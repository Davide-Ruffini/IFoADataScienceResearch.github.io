## Aims
Our aim is to construct highly flexible actuarial models such as:
<ul>
<li> finite mixture regression models for the number and the costs of claims; </li>
<li> univariate and multivariate regression models with varying dispersion and shape for claim frequencies and severities; </li>
<li> copula based models with regression structures on the mean, dispersion and dependence parameters for different claim types and their associated claim counts and costs; </li>
<li> first-order integer valued autoregressive INAR(1) regression models with varying dispersion for time series of claim counts; </li>
<li> neural network embeddings of the aforementioned models which are able to capture the stylized characteristics of structured, semi-structured and unstructured insurance data. </li>
</ul>
