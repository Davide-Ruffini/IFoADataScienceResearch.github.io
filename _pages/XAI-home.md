## Aims
1.	Demonstrate concepts behind XAI to IFoA members with a view to myth busting the notion that “Machine learning models are black boxes”
2.	Provide guidance notes around embedding XAI practices in any future actuarial work relying on AI. (Note that there is potential crossover here into Ethical AI and attitudes to AI in general).
