## What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining or emotion AI, refer to the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analytics to automatically determine the overall feeling a writer is expressing in a piece of text.

Sentiment classification is often framed as binary (positive/negative), ternary (positive/neutral/negative) or multi-class (for example neutral, happy, sad, anger, hate).
