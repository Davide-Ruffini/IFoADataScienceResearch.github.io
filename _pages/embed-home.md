## Aims
1. Explore interesting open source embedded insurance data sets and discuss how data analytics techniques can be used for actuarial applications, including risk selection (for life and GI products), identifying insurance opportunities and market segmentation.
2. Investigate the intersection of machine learning and traditional actuarial techniques in embedded insurance data, especially in the area of insurance product pricing and loss management

<b> Data Analytics in Embedded Insurance </b>
<br>
The emergence of Embedded Insurance is without a doubt the next evolution in the insurance industry. However, traditional actuarial analytics methodology such as pricing and risk management are still slow to adopt and leverage the large volume of alternative data collected. Examples include:
<ul>
  <li>
Using e-commerce shoppers’ purchase behaviour to estimate their lifestyle and needs to introduce and price relevant insurance
  </li>
<li>
Adjust motor insurance premium loadings according to detailed driving habits collected through in-car sensors
  </li>
<li>
Real time on-demand pricing of insurance risk based on drivers’ location and length of time spent on road 
</li>
</ul>
