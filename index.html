                <p>Netflix is honored to receive the Jury's choice award for Innovation at
                  <a href="http://jaxenter.com/jax-awards-winners-announced-at-jax-2015-conference-116358.html">JAX 2015 conference</a>.<p>
                <p>We would like to thank all of those who contribute to the Netflix open source community including our Netflix developers, all external contributors,
                  and our active user base.</p>
                <p>Netflix Open Source won the JAX Special Jury Award.  Jury member Neal Ford was quoted as saying "that architecture is
                  cool again, that it can be used as a business differentiator, and when done right it is a huge advantage. Netflix showed the power of internalizing
                  DevOps into their architecture; all architectures will do this in the future."</p>
